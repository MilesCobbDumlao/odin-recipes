        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef </li>
            <li>Tomato sauce </li>
            <li>Taco seasonings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium high heat. If using a stainless steel skillet, add in ½ tablespoon oil to prevent meat from sticking. </li>
            <li>Add in ground meat and begin to break up in small chunks as the meat browns, stirring frequently to evenly brown the meat. </li>
            <li>Once the meat is browned, drain off excess grease, if you have any. You can even blot with a paper towel to absorb more grease, if desired.</li>
            <li>Return drained meat to skillet and add in tomato sauce, ¼ cup water, and the seasonings.</li>
            <li>Simmer over medium heat until liquid from tomatoes has been absorbed, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
