        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            With a fun Mexican twist, this dish is chockfull of so many amazing flavors, 
            from the tangy lime juice to the hint of spiciness from the chili powder and 
            jalapeno. And not only is this healthy and nutritious but it's also unbelievably 
            easy to make. Simply throw everything into the skillet and that's it. Even the quinoa 
            is cooked right in the pan, really letting the flavors soak in.
